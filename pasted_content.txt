Thank you for your patience! I’m happy to go back to the original plan and make sure all your ideas are included. Below is a detailed and revised plan for the mobile app that helps Nigerians understand the costs of buying land and building a house. This plan focuses on flexibility, real-time data, and innovative materials like polystyrene, just as you envisioned. Let’s break it down step by step.

Revised Mobile App Plan
Core Features
	1	Land Cost Estimation
	◦	What It Does: Users tell the app their desired land size (e.g., 60sqm, 100sqm) and location (e.g., Lagos, Abuja).
	◦	How It Works: The app uses a free Large Language Model (LLM) to search the internet for the latest average land prices per square meter in that location, right at that moment.
	◦	What You Get: The app multiplies the land size by the real-time price and shows you the total estimated cost to buy the land.
	2	House Type Selection and Cost Forecasting
	◦	What It Does: Users pick a house type (e.g., 2-bedroom bungalow, 3-bedroom duplex) from templates or enter their own details (e.g., number of rooms, floors).
	◦	How It Works: The LLM checks current prices for building materials (like cement, sand, polystyrene panels) and labor rates in the user’s location.
	◦	What You Get: A full breakdown of how much it’ll cost to build the house, with no fixed prices—everything is fresh and up-to-date.
	3	Construction Steps Guide
	◦	What It Does: The app lists the steps to build your house (e.g., foundation, walls, roofing) based on your design.
	◦	How It Works: Each step comes with a simple explanation in pidgin English, like “Pour strong concrete for ground, then fix iron rods.”
	◦	What You Get: Real-time costs for materials and labor for each step, tailored to your location and house plan.
	4	Budgeting and Segmentation Tool
	◦	What It Does: Users enter how much money they have or earn monthly.
	◦	How It Works: The app figures out which construction steps you can afford now and how long you’ll need to save for the rest.
	◦	What You Get: For example, if you have ₦1,000,000 and the foundation costs ₦800,000, it’ll tell you to start there and give a savings plan for the next step.
	5	Detailed Pricing for Materials and Labor
	◦	What It Does: The app lists everything you need to build (e.g., cement, polystyrene panels, workers like masons).
	◦	How It Works: The LLM fetches the latest prices for your specific state or city in Nigeria.
	◦	What You Get: Something like “Cement in Lagos: ₦4,500 per bag (as of today).”
	6	Support for Innovative Materials (Polystyrene and Click Lock Blocks)
	◦	For Engineers:
	▪	The app explains how to use polystyrene for the whole house—foundation, walls, and roof.
	▪	Example: “Build concrete foundation first, fix iron rods, then put polystyrene panels with wire mesh. Spray cement on top to make am strong.”
	◦	For Polystyrene Producers:
	▪	It suggests cool ideas like perforated blocks for air and UV coatings to last long in Nigeria’s sun.
	▪	It also pushes for fire-safe and recycled plastic versions to keep costs low.
	7	LLM Chat Assistant
	◦	What It Does: A chat feature where users ask questions, and the app answers in simple English or pidgin.
	◦	Examples:
	▪	You: “How much for a duplex foundation in Abuja?”
	▪	App: “Based on today’s price, e go cost between ₦900,000 and ₦1.6 million. Which area you dey? I fit check better price.”
	▪	You: “Can I use polystyrene for everything?”
	▪	App: “Yes o, you fit use am for everything. Start with strong concrete foundation, add iron rods and polystyrene panels with wire mesh, then spray cement. E go keep your house cool and solid.”
	◦	Extras: It can make slow pidgin English videos with animations to explain tricky stuff, like building with polystyrene.
	◦	Factory Tips: It suggests visiting local polystyrene factories for better deals, like “Go check factory people for [your area] to get cheap panels wey fit your plan.”
	8	Data Storage
	◦	What It Does: Keeps your info in the app while you’re using it.
	◦	How It Works: You can save your project to the cloud (using Supabase’s free plan) with one click and a magic link sent to your email.

How It’s Built (Technical Side)
	1	Real-Time Data with LLM
	◦	The app uses a free LLM to search the web for current prices (e.g., “What’s the price of cement in Lagos today?”) and shows the results.
	2	No Fixed Data
	◦	Everything is live—no old prices. You can enter any land size or house design, and the app adjusts on the fly.
	3	Temporary Storage
	◦	Your info stays in the app’s memory while you use it. Some basic guides work offline, but prices need internet.
	4	Supabase Cloud
	◦	Save your project easily to Supabase with a magic link—no complicated setup.
	5	User Interface
	◦	Wizard Flow: Step-by-step screens like “Pick Location,” “Choose House,” “See Costs.”
	◦	Chat Window: Talk to the assistant anytime.
	◦	Videos: Watch simple explanations with text-to-speech and visuals.

How This Matches Your Ideas
	•	Real-Time Prices: The app grabs fresh costs for land, materials, and labor across Nigeria.
	•	Flexible Options: You can choose any land size or house style, and it works it out for you.
	•	Polystyrene Focus: Full guides on using polystyrene, with smart ideas like cement spraying and wire mesh.
	•	Pidgin English: Easy explanations anyone can follow.
	•	Factory Visits: Tips to connect with local producers for custom, affordable materials.

Sample How It Works
	1	You pick “Lagos” and say you want “80sqm” of land.
	2	The app checks today’s land price in Lagos and tells you the total cost.
	3	You choose a “3-bedroom bungalow” with polystyrene walls.
	4	It lists current prices for polystyrene, cement, and labor, then shows the full cost.
	5	You say you have ₦2,000,000.
	6	The app says you can do the foundation and some walls, then plans your savings for the rest.
	7	You ask, “How I go use polystyrene for wall?”
	8	It explains in pidgin and offers a video: “Fix iron rods, put polystyrene panels, add wire mesh, then spray cement.”
	9	You save your project to the cloud with one click and get a magic link.
